## FizzBuzz Kata

Since this is a simple exercise, I provided three different solutions.  They all have spec written for them.  The test suite can be run with:

`rspec spec`

If you'd like to run the solutions individually, they can be run with any of the following commands:

```
ruby if_block_fizzbuzz.rb
ruby concise_fizzbuzz.rb
ruby case_block_fizzbuzz.rb
```
